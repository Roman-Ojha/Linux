*) Definations:
  -> tmux consist of 3 main objects:
    1. Sessions
      -> it is a top layer and manage collections of windows managed as a single unit. 
      -> you can have any any number of session running at a time but only one session is attached at a time.
    2. Windows
      -> it is a second layer and manage collections of panes.
    3. Panes
      -> pane are the splits of a windows and represent an indeividual terminal session.
  -> To enter command to tmux you have to use prefix key which is by default ctrl + b. this is the key combination that you use to enter into command.
*) Default Commands
  -> tmux (start new session)
  *) Prefix command (ctrl + b)
    -> <prefix> % (split pane horizontally)
    -> <prefix> " (split pane vertically)
    -> <prefix> arrow key (to move to next pane)
    -> <prefix> { or } (move pane to left or right)
    -> <prefix> z (zoom pane)
    -> <prefix> x (kill pane)
    -> <prefix> q (show pane number and move to pane by number)
    -> <prefix> ! (break pane into new window)
    -> <prefix> c (create new window)
    -> <prefix> n (move to next window)
    -> <prefix> p (move to previous window)
    -> <prefix> <number> (move to window by number)
    -> <prefix> , (rename window)
    -> <prefix> & (kill window)
    -> <prefix> d (detach from session)
    -> <prefix> ? (show all key bindings)
    -> <prefix> : (enter command mode)
    -> <prefix> s (list sessions, from inside the session)
    -> <prefix> $ (rename session)
    -> <prefix> w (list of windows)
    -> <prefix> t (show time)
  -> tmux attach -t <session_name> (attach to session)
  -> tmux ls (list sessions)
  -> tmux rename-session -t <old_session_name> <new_session_name> (rename session)
  -> tmux new -s <session_name> (create new session)
  -> tmux kill-session -t <session_name> (kill session)
  -> tmux source ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf (reload or source tmux config, for that you have to be on the tmux session)

*) Tmux Configuration setup:
  *) Install Tmux plugin manager:
    -> https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm
  *) Create Tmux configuration file:
    -> touch ~/.config/tmux/.tmux.conf



unbind r
# referesh tmux configuration
