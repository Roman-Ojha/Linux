*) Tips:
  -> create '~/dotfiles' in user home directory
  -> put all the dotfiels inside '~/dotfiles' directory
  -> create a symbolic link for each dotfiles that exist on '.dotfiles' directory to user directory where os can access it.
  -> Now you can manage all your dotfiles in one place and can easily sync it with git.
  -> And put the '~/dotfiles' directory in git repository to sync it with git.
  -> you can use 'stow' to manage the dotfiles symlinks easily.
  -> we can check the symbolik link status using 'ls -lah <file-name>' command.
  -> whenever you will add new dotfiles into '~/dotfiles' directory, you need to create a symbolic link for that file, so you have to run 'stow <file-name>' or 'stow .' command to create symbolic links for all files in '~/dotfiles' directory.
