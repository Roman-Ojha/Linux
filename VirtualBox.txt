*) How to share folder in VirtualBox on Ubuntu Server from host:
    -> To access a shared folder in VirtualBox on Ubuntu Server, you can follow these steps:
    -> Install the VirtualBox Guest Additions in the guest OS. This is required to mount the shared folder. You can use the following command to install it: sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils.

    -> Create a shared folder in VirtualBox by right-clicking on your VM and selecting Settings > Shared Folders > Add new shared folder.

    -> In the Add Share prompt, select the Folder Path in your host that you want to be accessible inside your VM.

    -> Type a name for the Folder Name.

    -> Make sure that Read-only and Auto-mount are unchecked and Mount point is blank.

    -> Start the virtual machine.

    -> Mount the shared folder manually with the following command syntax: sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=$USER,gid=vboxsf [SHARE NAME] [MOUNT POINT]. Replace [SHARE NAME] with the name of your shared folder and [MOUNT POINT] with the directory where you want to mount it.
